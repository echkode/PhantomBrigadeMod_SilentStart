# SilentStart

A library mod for [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) to mute the sound played when the execute button is clicked.

It is compatible with game release version **2.1.0**. It works with both the Steam and Epic installs of the game. All library mods are fragile and susceptible to breakage whenever a new version is released.

This is a specialty mod. You'll know if you need it. There is a game option toggle to mute or unmute the sound.
